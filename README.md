## MHXX Copium Mod
A version of the original MHXX Cope Mod made by Aradi with extra changes.

Credits\Thanks:

Kuriimu2 devs. Wouldn't have been able to even start without the tool (found https://github.com/FanTranslatorsInternational/Kuriimu2)

Crosshex and whoever else worked on the 3DS MHXX translation project, because the 3DS version of MHGUCope is based on those files.

Deathcream (Discord: Deathcream#1576) and Moonbunnie (discord MoonBunnie#0001) for hearing me out and providing tech support on the game files. Mostly Deathcream, iirc.

Jeck95 (discord: Jeck95#4374) for hearing me out and prvoiding suggestions and a second opinion on most of these changes. Even if I did ignore him most the time.

NekotagaYuhatora, Fandirus, and Phemeto for helping out by explaining a lot of Prowler shit. Phemeto is the one to blame for most the changes tho.

Godhi and Drakesmalice/Vandreydra for hearing me out on GL and HH changes respectively, even if I may not have listened much.

AsteriskAmpersand and the rest of the MHModding community (Discord Server: https://discord.gg/gJwMdhK) for generally being there.

Jin Furai and his discord server members (link: https://discord.gg/7yEUUwA) for also being around tolerating my random bullshit.

Aradi147 for originally making Cope Mod. https://github.com/Aradi147/MHGUCope/tree/main

Vaccaria for fixing Blast Dash in the original Cope Mod.
